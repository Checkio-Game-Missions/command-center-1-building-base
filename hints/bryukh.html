        First you'll need to implement the "__init__" method. This method defines how an instance is
        created.
        <textarea data-code="python">
def __init__(self, south, west, width_WE, width_NS, height=10):
    self.south = south
    self.west = west
    self.width_WE = width_WE
    self.width_NS = width_NS
    self.height = height</textarea>
        Either that, or you can store all the coordinates for each corner and the wall positions.

        Next you need to implement the "__repr__" method. You can make it with "format".

        <textarea data-code="python">
def __repr__(self):
    return "Building({}, {}, {}, {}, {})".format(....)</textarea>
        I think you can fill values inside "format" brackets.

    <div class="answer">
        The corners can be calculated with the given values which you should have stored using the
        init method. Just return a string with with the defined keys and calculated values.

    <div class="answer">
        "Area" and "volume"  can be easily calculated using the width and height.
